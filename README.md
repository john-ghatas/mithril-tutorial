# Simple mithril example

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/john-ghatas/mithril-tutorial.svg?branch=master)

This repository contains a mithril app from the tutorial of Mithril.js, with ES 6 syntax and integrated Docker Service and Travis CI.

## Running the application

To run the webapp, the source code has to be compiled first. You can either compile the source code for production, or compile it live for development. <br/>

**Production compilation**

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**Development live compilation**

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

After compiling the application, open the index.html file in the browser.

**Happy hacking!**
